    "### 1. Programming Language\n",
    "A **programming language** is a formal language used to write instructions that a computer can execute. These instructions perform specific tasks or solve problems. Examples of programming languages include Python, R, MATLAB, Java, C++, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Interpreter\n",
    "An **interpreter** is a program that executes code line by line. It reads the source code, converts it into machine-readable instructions, and executes it on the spot. This allows you to run and test code quickly, but execution can be slower compared to compiled code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** Python, R, and MATLAB use interpreters.\n",
    "- **Advantage:** Immediate execution and testing.\n",
    "- **Disadvantage:** Slower execution for large programs compared to compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Compiler\n",
    "A **compiler** translates the entire source code of a program into machine code (binary code) in one go before execution. The machine code is saved as an executable file that can run directly on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** C, C++, and Java use compilers.\n",
    "- **Advantage:** Faster execution after compilation.\n",
    "- **Disadvantage:** Errors are found only after the entire code is compiled, and debugging can be harder.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Low-Level Programming Language\n",
    "A **low-level language** is closer to machine code and deals with hardware-specific operations. It provides less abstraction and is more difficult to write and maintain but offers more control over the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:** Assembly language, machine code.\n",
    "- **Features:** More efficient and faster as it directly interacts with hardware.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Control Structures\n",
    "**Control structures** determine the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions or loops. Common control structures are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If-Else Statements:** Execute code based on conditions.\n",
    "  - Example: `if (x > 0) { print(\"Positive\") } else { print(\"Negative\") }`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Loops:** Execute a block of code repeatedly.\n",
    "  - **For Loop:** Repeats code for a set number of times.\n",
    "  - **While Loop:** Repeats code while a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Algorithm\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "**Object-Oriented Programming** is a programming paradigm where code is organized into objects that represent real-world entities. These objects can contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that act on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:** Classes and objects are key concepts in OOP.\n",
